For example to import the module to your application, app.module.ts should have the following:\ntypescript\nimport { DLJsonViewerModule } from 'dl-json-viewer';\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    DLJsonViewerModule\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nUse\nAdd the lib-dl-json-viewer directive/element to your component with the appropriate inputs to render the object.\nhtml\n\nThe above code snippet will show the object jsonObj (in the current component's members) with an indentation of 4 spaces.\nComponent Inputs\n|Input|Type|Description|\n|-|-|-|\n|obj|any|The JSON object or array or native to be rendered by the component.|\n|tab-space|number|The number of spaces to use for indentation.|\n|config|any|The configuration object. See Configuration for more information.|\nConfiguration\nThe configuration object contains the following properties:\n|Property|Type|Description|\n|-|-|-|\n|marker|object|The object which contains strings to demarcate an object or array.|\n|marker.array|object|The object which contains strings to demarcate an array.|\n|marker.array|object|The object which contains strings to demarcate an object.|\n|marker.array.separator|string|The string which separates elements in an array.|\n|marker.array.open|string|The string which indicates the start of an array.|\n|marker.array.close|string|The string which indicates the end of an array.|\n|marker.object.separator|string|The string which separates elements (key-value pair) in an object.|\n|marker.object.keyValueSeparator|string|The string which separates the key from value in an element.|\n|marker.object.open|string|The string which indicates the start of an object.|\n|marker.object.close|string|The string which indicates the end of an object.|\nBelow is the object structure and the default values:\ntypescript\nconst DefaultConfig: any = {\n    \"markers\": {\n        \"array\": {\n            \"separator\": \",\",\n            \"open\": \"[\",\n            \"close\": \"]\"\n        },\n        \"object\": {\n            \"separator\": \",\",\n            \"open\": \"{\",\n            \"close\": \"}\",\n            \"keyValueSeparator\": \":\"\n        }\n    }\n};\nThe default values for the configuration is the DefaultConfig object which can be found in the default.config.ts file.\nDemo\nThis application is a demonstration of the use of the component. The app component contains the jsonObj field which is passed as input to json of the component. This object is bound (two-way) to the text-area input in the view, so when there is text input in the text-area and the View button is clicked then the viewJSON method in the app component is called which updates the input of the JSON viewer component and the object is then rendered in the view. To run the application use the Angular CLI command:\nsh\nng serve\nDocumentation\nThe documentation for this project is generated using Compodoc tool.
